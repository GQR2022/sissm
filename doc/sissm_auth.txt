Simple Insurgency Sandstorm Server Manager - SISSM
SISSM Authorization System "Auth"
JS Schroeder -- last updated:  2019.10.26

If you are running a server with small group of trusted admins, use of this module is
optional - you may find it more convenient to list all your admins as root users (sissm.rootguids).  Root user
will automatically granted all privileges and commands.

If you have large number of admins, requiring tighter control of privilges, you may setup
the SISSM auth module.

The auth module supports custom creation of up to 6 groups [0] to [5].  For example,
you may choose to define them to be: Senior Admins, Regular Admins, Moderators, Patrons, Developers, 
Unbanned Parolees, etc.

In addition to the 6 custom groups, picladmin defines two reserved groups: 'root' and 'everyone',
to total 8 distinct groups.

For each group you may specify allowed list of picladmin commands and list of attributes (privileges)
used by various SISSM plugins.  The user list format is compatible with Admin.txt file
used by Sandstorm dedicated server comprised of list of Steam GUIDs.  

A single player may belong to multiple lists for stackable privileges.

*  'Root' group (you may specify more than one) has ALL privileges and may use ALL commands.  Therefore, there are
no entries for command or privilege lists.

*  'Everyone' group describe all unprivileged clients, therefore there are no entries for GUIDs.  
'Everyone' group describe all visitors to your server without any special privileges.  You may
specify list of unprivileged commands and attributes that you grant to your general community.

*  Custom group is described by five fields:  1) name of group, 2) attributes, 3) list of allowed commands, 
4) list of allowed macros, and 5) path to file containing list of GUIDs (user IDs).

Follow the example sissm.cfg (see below) to configure your custom groups and privileges.

Here are some example sissm.groupguid[*] paths to help you, for both Linux and Windows servers:

sissm.groupguid[0] "/home/ins/iss/Insurgency/Config/Server/Admins.txt"
sissm.groupguid[0] "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\sandstorm_server\Insurgency\Config\Server\Admins.txt"

Macro capability (picladmin) extends your server by allowing you to create your own commmands.  These commands can be
assigned to different privilege levels, including "everyone".  While *all* macros can be executed by those with !execute
or !x command privilege, you can specify each to be assigned to different privilege levels for direction execution 
(instead of "!x morebots", you type "!morebots").  This advanced topic is discussed in sissm_advanced.txt appnote.
