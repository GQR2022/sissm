Note:  If you are running only a single game instance on your machine, or running
multiple game instances from a seprate install folder, you may ignore this appnote.

Note:  If you are setting up to run multiple game instances on the same machine using 
the "Sandstorm Admin Wrapper (SAW)", you need to read this appnote.

SISSM is designed to manage a single game server instance.  It is very common for game hosters to run
multiple game servers on a single multi-core machine.  For this, you will run multiple instances
of SISSM, with unique sissm.cfg file corresponding to each of your game server instance.

Difficulty arises when multiple game instances are run from the same game install folder.  This is not
a recommended practice, but it has the advantage of being very disk space efficient.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1)  Your Server Launcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you must specify a unique game log file for each of the instances of your launcher.  
This is done by replacing the "-log" launcher argument with "-log=filename.ext".

For example, if you are running server1, server2, and server3, then specify each game launcher
to generate log file with names server1.log, server2.log and server3.

------------------------
For Server1, launch with:
InsurgencyServer-Win64-Shipping.exe { other parameters } -log=server1.log

For Server2, launch with:
InsurgencyServer-Win64-Shipping.exe { other parameters } -log=server2.log

For Server3, launch with:
InsurgencyServer-Win64-Shipping.exe { other parameters } -log=server3.log
------------------------

This step is necessary, because without specifying the output log file, Sandstorm 
will auto-name the log files based on the boot order as Insurgency.log, Insurgency_1.log,
Insurgency_2.log, etc.  There is no easy method of telling SISSM which server correponds 
to which log file, because servers can be rebooted in any order, at any time.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2)  Creating a Separate SISSM.CFG files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setup your multiple instances of SISSM, each with corresponding configuration file, named as
sissm1.cfg, sissm2.cfg and sissm3.cfg.  Simply specify in each configuration the corresponding
game log file you assigned.  You do this by modifying the "sissm.GameLogFile" parameter:

------------------------
In sissm1.cfg:
sissm.GameLogFile "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/sandstorm_server/Insurgency/Saved/Log/server1.log

In sissm2.cfg:
sissm.GameLogFile "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/sandstorm_server/Insurgency/Saved/Log/server2.log

In sissm3.cfg:
sissm.GameLogFile "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/sandstorm_server/Insurgency/Saved/Log/server3.log
------------------------


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3)  Other Filenames that must be Unique, Including the Plugin Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the .cfg and .log files you should walk through your sissm.cfg files to make sure 
multiple instances of sissm does not cause a file "write" conflict.  For example, you will need to specify
unique "sissm.LogFile" (default "sissm.log"), or the "piwebgen.webFileName" parameter (default "sissm.html") 
that generates .html status page per server.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4)  Running Multiple Instances of SISSM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you can run three instances of SISSM, like this:

./ssism.exe sissm1.cfg
./ssism.exe sissm2.cfg
./ssism.exe sissm3.cfg


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Annex:  Why You May Not Want To Do This
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the time of writing, Sandstorm server allows you to specify custom file paths for the following
by changing the individual launcher parameters:
*  Insurgency.log
*  Game.ini
*  Admins.txt

To the best of my knowlege it cannot specify unique file paths for the folowing:
*  Engine.ini
*  Bans.json

For this reason you may need to study the consequence for running multiple instances of your server
from a single shared folder.

This author, who runs multiple Linux dedicated ISS servers, implements are 
compromise solution by creating separate server folders for each instance BUT making a 
soft symbolic link ("ln -s") of the "Contents" folder only, pointing to the first install instance.
This is where all game .pak files reside.  These are HUGE so it saves approximately 5gb of 
space per additional instance you provide for your community of players.
