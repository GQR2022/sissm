Simple Insurgency Sandstorm Server Manager - SISSM
SISSM Controlled Server Reboots
JS Schroeder -- last updated:  2019.09.03

==========================

The Sandstorm server doesn't have built-in "restart" or a "reboot" capability.  SISSM can only issue "quit" (RCON) or "terminate" (Operating System) actions to the game server.

In order to implement such SISSM-initiated server reboot, your game launcher script must be placed in a
loop to look something like this:

rem Windows version (.bat):
:start
   InsurgencyServer-Win64-Shipping.exe { params }
   timeout 20
   goto start


# Linux version (.sh):
while true
do
    ./InsurgencyServer-Linux-Shipping { params }
    sleep 20 
done

In the above loop examples, when the running Insurgency server is terminated, it waits for
20 seconds, then the new server instance is started.  This is your 'restart' loop.
SISSM, therefore, needs to merely kill the existing game server instance to induce a "reboot".

There are two methods SISSM uses to terminate the game server process - soft and hard.   In the 
'soft' kill method, RCON command "quit" is sent to the game server, shutting down the process.  
In 'hard' kill option, SISSM issues a command to the operatoring system (Linux or Windows) to kill the process.  

The 'soft' implementation is an easy one, and there is nothing extra to setup.  However, this is not a very 
reliable way to force the game server to shut down.  If the game server is "stuck", SISSM cannot
communicate with the server to initiate the needed shutdown.

The 'hard' kill approach is much better, but it requires the server operator to provide a script
for SISSM to execute.  Once done, this custom script should be tested by calling it "by hand" to make sure
the running server successfully terminate, and the aforementioned loop will restart it.

How does SISSM know which one to use?  If the sissm.cfg parameter sissm.RestartScript is an empty string, then
the soft kill method is used:

sissm.RestartScript   ""                                 // reboot script of your server

If the same parameter has path to your script, then SISSM will call this whenever a "restart"
is needed by one or more of the plugins.

sissm.RestartScript  "/home/ins/scripts/restart1.sh"    // reboot script of your server

The 'hard' kill option is not available if you are using the restricted version of SISSM.  This is to
enhance cybersecurity for the Game Services Provider (GSP).
