Sadly, Sandstorm Dedicated Server has a history of instability.  Sometimes it enters a state where
no one can connect.  When the server is hard-at-work for many hours, lags and rubber-bandings
are observed by the gamers.  In short, SISSM-controlled automated server
reboots can help to run a smoother, more stable server for your game clients.

Here are the reboot tactics:

1.  Reboot the server, busy or idle, when it hasn't been rebooted for more than XX hours

2.  Reboot the server when idle for more than YY minutes.  There are two reasons for this:
a) we always want to start with a "recently rebooted" server before players start to 
arrive, after which the server may be busy for many hours.  We want to minimize rebooting in 
the middle of the game.  b) The server may be "idle" because nobody can sign in
due to a server failure.  By rebooting you are mitigating this anomaly.

3.  Reboot the server when it is dead.  This is detected by dead RCON interface, zero activities
in the server logs.  Dead servers should be rebooted as soon as possible - ZZ minutes
upon initial detection.  We don't want immediate action for various reasons, one of which
is to avoid being in a "high speed reboot loop" due to a corrupt server image/configuration.

4.  Reboot the server when it is hung.  Hung servers are characterised by a) functioning
RCON, b) functioning log activity.  In this state, the server may read back empty or 
"ghost" (non-existent) players.  Clients trying to connect to hung servers typically
see "95% stuck" problem during connection.

5.  Reboot the server once a day.

Setup:

First enable the REBOOTER plugin in your sissm.cfg file by turning on pirebooter.logUpdateSec.  
This allows you to monitor how our reboot timers are incrementing.  This is useful for 
diagnostics, but will also help you gauge "how much time do I have before the next 
reboot kicks in."

pirebooter.pluginState                1                 // 1=enable plugin, 0=disable plugin
pirebooter.logUpdateSec              60      // report rate, counter state to log file (sec)

The five limits are for the aforementioned 5 cases described, all but daily reboot is 
expressed in units of seconds.  Program it to your liking.  

pirebooter.rebootBusySec          18000                                 // 5*60*60 (5 hours)
pirebooter.rebootIdleSec           1200                                    // 20*60 (20 min)
pirebooter.rebootDeadSec            300                                     // 5*60 ( 5 min)
pirebooter.rebootHungSec           1200                                    // 20*60 (20 min)

For daily reboot, set the hh:mm in 24-hour format.  Empty string "" will disable
this feature.

pirebooter.rebootDailyHM             ""   // daily reboot format hh:mm:  "", "01:00", 23:35"

Set your limits to your needs, and restart SISSM.
