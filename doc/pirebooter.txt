Sadly, Sandstorm Dedicated Server has a history of instability.  Sometimes it enters a stage where
nobody can connect.  When the server is hard-at-work for many hours, we start to experience
lags, rubber banding, and client-server sync issues.  In short, SISSM-controlled automated server
reboots can help to run a smooth server for your clients.

Here are the 'reboot tactics':

1.  Reboot the server when it hasn't been rebooted for more than xx hours

2.  Reboot the server when it is idle for more than YY minutes.  There are two reasons for this:
a) we always want to start with a "recently rebooted" server because once the players start to 
arrive, it may be busy for many hours.  We want to minimize rebooting in the middle of the
game when rule#1 kicks in.  b) The server may be "idle" because nobody can sign in
due to a server failure.  By rebooting you are possibly clearing this anomaly.

3.  Reboot the server when it is dead.  This is detected by dead RCON interface, zero activities
in the server logs.  Dead servers should be rebooted as soon as possible - ZZ minutes
upon initial detection.  We don't want immediate action for various reasons, one of which
is to avoid being in a "high speed reboot loop" due to a corrupt server image/configuration.

First enable the REBOOTER plugin, and turn on pirebooter.logUpdateSec.  This allows you to 
monitor how our reboot timers are incrementing.  This is useful for diagnostics, but will also
help you gauge "how much time do I have before the next reboot kicks in."

pirebooter.pluginState                1                 // 1=enable plugin, 0=disable plugin
pirebooter.logUpdateSec              60      // report rate, counter state to log file (sec)

The three limits for the aforementioned 3 cases are here, all expressed in units of seconds.
Program it to your liking.  

pirebooter.rebootBusySec          18000                                 // 5*60*60 (5 hours)
pirebooter.rebootIdleSec           1200                                //    20*60 (20 min)
pirebooter.rebootDeadSec            300                                 //     5*60 ( 5 min)
