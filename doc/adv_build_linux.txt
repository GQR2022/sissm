=====================

This instruction is for Debian/Ubuntu tree.  Your commands may differ
for other branches of Linux such as Redhat.


1) Install compile tools

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential

2) Unzip sissm/src

$ md ~/[your work area]
$ cd ~/[your work area]
$ unzip [SISSM release source].zip

This will create a 'src' subfolderw under [your work area] containing
all source files, and 'Makefile' will appear at ~/[your work area]

3) Compile to generate 'sissm' binary

$ cd ~/[your work area]

Note - do not go into 'src' folder

$ make clean
$ make

If there are no errors, you will find 'sissm' binary executable
in the folder ~/[your work area]/build
