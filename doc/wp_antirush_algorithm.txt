Simple Insurgency Sandstorm Server Manager - SISSM
Implementing a Tri-state Objective Capture Timer
JS Scheorder - last revised:  2019.08.21
=================

Statement of the Problem:

Majority of Sandstorm players are casual arcaders - they play for speed ("play the objective"),
most often uncoordinated, and always running.  The default and official server
parameters are set to encourage this, with only 5 minute alloted between the objectives,
and fast rate for objective capture (30 seconds with multiplier).

For the minority tactical team players, we end up lagging one full checkpoint behind (i.e., 
while we are still re-supplying, someone else has already captured the next objective).

When the speed players evade through enemy bots to reach the next objective, the AI algorithm
raises the bot alertness level, thus diminishing the survival rate of the tactical team.

Analyzing this scenario there are three cases to model:

Case-1:  Everybody is a speed player
Case-2:  Everybody is a methodical team player
Case-3:  Mix of both

SISSM ("bopeep2") implements a 3-state objective capture rate timer to address Case-1
and Case-3, with minimum impact to the Case-2 scenarios.

Three territorial "objective capture rates" are implemented:

"Normal" -- 30 seconds with 25% multiplier for up to 2 or 3 people (factory default)
"Slow"   -- 90 seconds with no accelerator multiplier
"Locked" -- 180 seconds with no accelerato multiplier (basically this is "capture disabled")

The Algorithm:
=====================

Whenever SISSM detects an objective capture, the server is re-programmed according
to number of players in the game.  (These parameters can be adjusted in the 
SISSM configuration file.)

1-2 players:  no rate throttling 

3-5 players:  for the first 135 seconds, SLOW rate; NORMAL rate after

6+ players::  for the first 180 seconds, LOCKED rate; NORMAL rate after

The concept is that the runner-players quickly arriving on territorial objectives
is forced to wait until the (long) timer runs out.

Social engineering design:  The "Locked" rate was added to the algorithm due to
NWI's recent introduction of "group join to a community server" feature.  Often
a group of non-tactical players will indiscriminantly join any populated server 
to play no differently than if they were on a matchmaking server.  They
beeline to the objective, but become bored after waiting 2-3 minutes
of doing "nothing" (while a massive firefight is going on outside).  This has a
positive effect of such arcaders disconnecting voluntarily from the 
tactical community servers.


Use Case Analysis:
=====================

Case-1:  Everybody is a speed player
Everybody arrives at objective early, but will see slow capture rate until
the timer expires.  Meanwhile all the bots the players left undead (plus 
the 2nd wave spawn) will attack the capture point for an added entertainment.

Case-2:  Everybody is a methodical team player
Everybody arrives late, it is likely they won't see the "slow" capture rate at all.

Case-3:  Mix of both
Speed players arrives early to see the "Slow rate" but will be enterained
by extra attacking bots at the objective while waiting for the rest of the team.
Tactical players can take their time practicing methodical movements, with
less worry of start of counterattack before their arrival at the objective.


Pre-Requisite:
=====================

Use of this plugin assumes that 1) You are hosting a slow-tactical server, and 
2) you have extended the time between the objective captures
(default 5 minutes is too short IMHO -- 15 minutes is recommended).


Shortfalls and Future Improvements:
====================================

Currently there is little or nothing can be done about players rushing
to the destruction objective (weapons cache).  This is due to lack of 
event information I can extract from the NWI server software.

Currently the timing and rate parameters are a single set of values for
all maps, all objectives.  In the future the plugins can be expanded
to be "map aware" and dynamically adjust some of the parameters according
to distance between the objectives.
