Simple Insurgency Sandstorm Server Manager - SISSM
Implementing a Tri-state Objective Capture Timer for Checkpoint Mode
JS Scheorder - last revised:  2020.04.16
=================

Statement of the Problem:

Majority of Sandstorm players are casual arcaders - they play for speed ("play the objective"),
most often uncoordinated, and always running.  The default and official server
parameters are set to encourage this, with only 5 minute alloted between the objectives,
and fast rate for objective capture (30 seconds with multiplier).  There is nothing to 
impede a rogue player from sneaking past the enemy AIs to explode the weapons cache objective.

For the minority tactical team players, we end up lagging one full checkpoint behind (i.e., 
while we are still re-supplying, someone else has already captured the next objective).

When the speed players evade through enemy bots to reach the next objective, the AI algorithm
raises the bot alertness level, thus diminishing the survival rate of the tactical team.

Analyzing this scenario there are three cases to model:

Case-1:  Everybody is a speed player
Case-2:  Everybody is a methodical team player
Case-3:  Mix of both

SISSM implements a 3-state objective capture/destruct rate timer to address Case-1
and Case-3, with minimum impact to the Case-2 scenarios.

Three territorial "objective capture rates" are implemented:

"Normal" -- 30 seconds with 25% multiplier for up to 2 or 3 people (factory default)
"Slow"   -- 90 seconds with no accelerator multiplier
"Locked" -- 180 seconds with no accelerato multiplier (basically this is "capture disabled")

For "destructive objectives" (i.e., weapons cache destruction) the only recourse is to
enable player auto-kick.  It uses the same timer as the territorial objective
except that if a player "blows" the cache during "Slow" or "Locked" timing window,
he is automatically kicked from the server, with a nice explanation in the reason field.
Since this is just a kick, the player has the option to immediately come back if
so desired.


The Algorithm:
=====================

Whenever SISSM detects an objective capture, the server is re-programmed according
to number of players in the game.  (These parameters can be adjusted in the 
SISSM configuration file.)  Here are the defaults:

1-2 players:  no rate throttling 

3-4 players:  for the first 135 seconds, SLOW rate; NORMAL rate after

5+ players::  for the first 180 seconds, LOCKED rate; NORMAL rate after

The concept is that the runner-players quickly arriving on territorial objectives
is forced to wait until the (long) timer runs out.   Likewise, the "run to destroy
weapons cache" behavior will result in an auto-kick.

Social engineering design:  The "Locked" rate was added to the algorithm due to
NWI's recent introduction of "group join to a community server" feature.  Often
a group of non-tactical players will indiscriminantly join any populated server 
to play no differently than if they were on a matchmaking server.  They
beeline to the objective, but gets auto-kicked or become bored after waiting 2-3 minutes
of doing "nothing" (while a massive firefight is going on outside).  This has a
positive effect of such arcaders disconnecting by choice or by auto-kick.


Use Case Analysis:
=====================

Case-1:  Everybody is a speed player
Everybody arrives at objective early, but will see slow capture rate until
the timer expires.  Meanwhile all the bots the players left undead (plus 
the 2nd wave spawn) will attack the capture point for an added entertainment.
For destructive objecive, the person triggering the explosion early will get 
kicked.

Case-2:  Everybody is a methodical team player
Everybody arrives late, it is likely they won't see the "slow" capture rate at all.

Case-3:  Mix of both
Speed players arrives early to see the "Slow rate" but will be enterained
by extra attacking bots at the objective while waiting for the rest of the team.
Tactical players can take their time practicing methodical movements, with
less worry of start of counterattack before their arrival at the objective.
For destructive objecive, the person triggering the explosion early will get 
kicked.


Pre-Requisite:
=====================

Use of this plugin assumes that 1) You are hosting a slow-tactical server, and 
2) you have extended the time between the objective captures
(default 5 minutes is too short IMHO -- 15 minutes is recommended).

For auto-kicking players that explodes the weapons cache early, an modification
is required to Engine.ini file.  See sissm_example.cfg piantirush section for
details.
