 
Beta 01.3 (0.1.3) 20191027

    This is a fast-turn bug hotfix release; also contains some experimental code
    No changes to the sissm.cfg (sissm_example.cfg) from Beta 01.2 - please update the binary only

    Fixed case sensitivity to !allowin name mask -- it is now case insensitive
    Fixed corrupted SessionID in sissm.log (extra CR at the end)
    Fixed a bug 'everyone' group could not execute picladmin commands allowed for 'everyone' in sissm.cfg

    Modifying core to now track game progress; updated piwebgen to reflect new data
    Piwebgen now shows map name on startup (no waiting for the map change after restart)

Beta 01.2 (0.1.2) 20191026

    Added "server nightly reboot" option (pirebooter)
    Added Event & web display of game Session ID to faciliate playback and delayed game monitoring
    Moved HTML tag filter from pigateway to piwebgen
    Fixed error in sissm_example.cfg ("macros" -> "execute" in privilege list)
    Macros are now directly executable (!x shotguns -> !shotguns), 
        You may, then, associate each with privilege level,  by group, including 'everyone' group
    Add 'unbanid' to admins command  - requires SteamID64 of the person you wish to unban
    !bs (bot scaled) command is now polymorphic.  Admins can type !bs [max] or !bs [min max]
        Example 1:  "!bs 40" sets scaling bot between botMinDefault to 40, 
        Example 2:  "!bs 6 40" sets the same range 6 to 40
    !bd (bot difficulty) is now floating point.  Instead of !bd 5 (defeault) you can say, e.g., !bd 5.234
    !bs and !bf now supports soloplayer mode (friendly bots/wave respawn checkpoint variant when 'bbots true')
    !ml and '!help list' now segments list output to 'say' box to support growing size of list
    !bs default minimumenemies, and max bots allowed by admin command can be changed in sissm.cfg (picladmin)
        Formerly these were hard-coded to 3 and 60, respectively
    New document: doc/sissm_advanced_macros.txt - create your own admin commands, assign privilege

1.  picladmin block:  Changed all default fun-responses to be shorter (fits on one line)

2.  Added bad words file path variable.  Simply add profanity words here, one word per line.
A (clean) example badwords.txt file is in the release package.  This is used to compare against
connecting player name.  If the bad-name plugin is enabled, the user is kicked.  To obtain
the horrific version of badwords.txt used by the author of this package, contact me via 
Steam ("shroeder_lvb"), Discord "Shchroeder#7524", or email: schroeder-lvb@outlook.com).
