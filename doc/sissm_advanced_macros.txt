Simple Insurgency Sandstorm Server Manager - SISSM
SISSM Advanced Macros Setup Note
JS Schroeder -- last updated:  2019.10.26

This appnote is for advanced users of SISSM, with large gaming community and many admins.
This procedure uses SISSM core, picladmin, and piclgreeting to extend your server with custom commands
and assigning each to different privileges.

* * * 

SISSM picladmin plugin supports many built-in commands for your admins to change server behavior
through the in-game chat text.  For example:

     !bs 8 32 

sets the scaled bot count for minimumenemies=4 and maximumenemies=16 (yes, it's divided by 2, because
there are two waves per objectives).

SISSM also has auth module (sissm core) that lets you grant each SISSM with various privilege levels.
For example you don't want everyone issuing RCON server reboot - perhaps Senior-Admins only.

PICLADMIN module also allows operators to create and define macros, a series of rcon commands you can 
string together to let your admins do some powerful things, for example, if you specify in sissm.cfg:

...
picladmin.macros[32]  "bots_default::say Normal::gamemodeproperty minimumenemies 4::gamemodeproperty maximumenemies 17"
picladmin.macros[33]  "rules::say Please visit  http://www.example.com/rules"
...

It lets anyone with "execute" privilege run these as:

!x bots_default
!x rules

This is where it gets interesting.  What if you want to add commands for your Moderators
or "everyone", but you don't want to give entire Execute privilege to lower level users 
(which is very dangerous).  So by extending the above macros examples, add these to the
SISSM's auth block like so:

...
sissm.groupname[2]   "Moderator"
sissm.groupattr[2]   "priport"
sissm.groupcmds[2]   "help version botscaled botdifficulty kick kickid"
sissm.groupmcrs[2]   "rules bots_default"
sissm.groupguid[2]   "/home/ins/iss/Insurgency/Config/Server/Admins-Moderators.txt"
...
sissm.everyoneattr   ""
sissm.everyonecmds   "help version info"
sissm.everyonemacros "rules"


Now Moderators can type "!bots_default" to reset bot count of your server.

Everyone can type "!rules" at any time to see the web URL of where you posted the server rules.
You should probably publish this by using pigreetings plugin, like so:

...
pigreetings.showads           1
pigreetings.adsDelay         15
pigreetings.adsInterval       0
pigreetings.serverads[0]     "Welcome new players. Type !rules"
...
