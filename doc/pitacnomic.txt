Tacttical Communications Without Microphone - SISSM
PITACNOMIC Plugin (PI-TAC-NO-MIC)
JS Schroeder -- last updated:  2019.11.23

=====================
Introduction
=====================

PITACNOMIC plugin enables tactical communication for the "microphone-challenged",
i.e., people that do not speak into microphone for one of many reasons:

*  No microphone hardware
*  Voice-shy
*  Cannot speak the language local to your server
*  Speech/Hearing impaired
*  Playing games at work (NOT recommended!)

This plugin was created to accomodate increasing number of "silent gamers" that would like
to play tactically, but are limited by due to the communications shortfalls.

How does it work?  Say you define "cc" to say "Cover me while I'm resupplying...",
and "tt" to say "Thanks!",  then a player on your server just have to type "y" to 
open chat, followed by  "cc<return>" in chat.  The system will display 
"Cover me while I'm resupplying."   And don't forget to say "tt"...

This also allows no-voice players to play the commander role.  If you prefix an
asterisk ("*") before the text definition it will "triple print" this on screen.  
Say, if you defined "qq" with "*Support call incoming - GET BACK EVERYONE!!", then 
upon pressing "qq" everyone will see:

    *Support call ordered - STAY BACK EVERYONE!!
    *Support call ordered - STAY BACK EVERYONE!!
    *Support call ordered - STAY BACK EVERYONE!!

Triple-printing is very eye catching, if used conservatiely!

All 2-letter codes can have up to 2 associated texts.  If you just defined one, it will always
use that one.  If you define the second text, first one will be used if the next objective
is territorial capture; second one, a destructive (weapons) cache.

For example, define "bb" as "**Breaching Capture Point in 5-sec!" and "**Exploding Cache in 5-sec!".
The silent player has to only remember "bb" to let their teammates know they are about
to make the critical move,  and rest of the team have 5 seconds to yell "wait!" if not ready.

Two letter codes can be any two letters like "ab" "xy"... but it is much easier to type
if they are double letter like "aa".

Example sissm.cfg defines "55", "44", "33", "22", and "11" in order of typical tactical
sequence for Checkpoint game mode.  

These are not to be confused with PICLADMIN commands (admin commands, typically prefixed
with "!" such as !bd for changing bot difficulty.  PITACNOMIC sequence is available for
everyone to use, including the admins.  The plugin can be disabled in entirety and it will
have no effect on PICLADMIN plugin.

=====================
Human Factors
=====================

This is like learning a new language - Get your silent players to use, perhaps, 
just two shortcuts "22" and "44" in example below -- one to prepare for objective and another to execute.  
After they get a hang of it, they can learn the rest of your custom sequences.

=====================
Configuring PITACNOMIC
=====================

Please see the Annex below for example sissm.cfg segment of PITACNOMIC.

First enable the plugin:  pitacnomic.pluginState.

Everything is fairly self-explanatory.  Each entry is defined deliminated by :: separator.
Following the two letter code, some lines have one text, and some have two.  If you see
an asterisk ("*") in front of the text, it will be triple printed.
