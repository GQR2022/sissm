=====================

1) Download and install Visual Studio
 
    https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
    Download Visual Studio -> Community Edition installer
    Run the downloaded installer
    Choose: "Desktop development with C++" which includes the Core, MSVC and Windows 10 SDK.
    (Only the command line "msvc" is quired)
    Reboot your PC

2) Unzip sissm/src

    Unpack the distribution source code .zip file to an empty folder.  
    It will create a 'src' subfolder where all source files remain.

    From Start->Visual Studio 2019, start "Developer Command Prompt for VS" or 
    "Developer PowerShell for VS"

    Navigate to the 'src' folder via the cd command.

3) Compile to generate 'sissm.exe'

    You must be defaulted to the 'src' folder.  Type:

    cl *.c Ws2_32.lib /Fesissm.exe
