SISSM Product Summary
==============================

SISSM is designed to run quietly alongside your Sandstorm community server 
to monitor and execute various automated algorithms to provide added security
and to enhance gaming experience for your player base.

SISSM is partitioned into two parts: "core" and "plugins". 

*  "Core" handles low-level interfaces and monitoring of the Sandstorm
server.  The primary function of the core is to provide background
server tracking, event handling/dispatching, and command/status APIs 
to the plugin layer.  The core interfaces with the Sandstorm server by 
polling game log file, and commununicating via the RCON interfaces.

*  All functional features of SISSM are implemented as "plugins".  SISSM comes 
with many useful plugins which can be enabled/disabled individually 
according to your needs.  See section "Included Plugins" below for 
list of summaries.   A new or modified plugins may be written by
the third party via the SISSM API.

SISSM is a background game server helper, and is not designed to be
a remote management or a server setup/configuration tool.  


Operating Systems 
==============================

SISSM runs and tested primarily on Linux platforms.  Windows version
is also available but it is not stress tested at this time 
(please report bugs).
