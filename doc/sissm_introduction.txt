Simple Insurgency Sandstorm Server Manager - SISSM
Introduction to SISSM

What is it?
==============================

SISSM is a server application designed to run alongside your Insurgency Sandstorm dedicated server software.  It is designed to be an "unattended watchdog" for your server.  It is not a remote management tool, nor a server setup tool.

SISSM must execute on the same machine hosting your Sandstorm server.  This is because SISSM requires local access to read the Insurgency.log file to track game state in real-time.  SISSM will NOT work in most GSP-hosted environments, not recommended for GSP use due to its complex nature.

*  Compiled for Linux and Windows servers
*  Auto-reboots ISS servers for stability, as non-intrusively as possible, with early warnings sent to your game clients
*  Adaptive Checkpoint mode Anti-rusher algorithm adjusts territorial objective capture rate
*  Auto-kicks bad-name players
*  Reserved slots for approved list of players (typically Admins.txt)
*  Sent to your game clients: greetings (2 lines at start) and server rules (up to 10 items)
*  Sent to your game clients: player connects and disconnects -- with incognito option for a short list of admins
*  "First Player Downgrade" makes gameplay easier for a lone player - helps to prime the empty servers
*  "Ruleset Override" sets server properties locked by some rulesets, such as bot count in Frenzy mode
*  "Command line Administrator" allows your admins in-game control of the server including rudiementary macro execution
*  "Dynamic Bot" allows adjusting min/max bot counts per map per objective-leg -- also works with wave respawn checkpoint
*  "Tactical No-Mic" allows non-microphone users to communicate by typing 2-letter codes of common tactical phrases
*  HTML server status generator
*  Provides in-game chat-box command line interface for the admins
*  Setup custom admin privilege levels each group with attributes and list of allowed commands
*  Includes RCON Terminal mini-tool for server operators and modders
*  Generates a player connection log to help facilitate after-the-fact ban
*  Configured through a single .cfg file, per server.  All plugins can be enabled/disabled individually.

Miscellaneous Features:

*  All functional features are implemented through plugins.  You can write your own, or modify an existing one!
*  Localization: Most SISSM messages sent to your game clients are all in SISSM's config file.  This makes localization possible.


How does it work?
==============================

SISSM communicates with your ISS dedicated server by tracking game log file and communicating through RCON.  

SISSM uses only the officially published information from NWI and UE4.  No reverse engineering was done. **


How do I install and run it?
==============================

1.  Download the source code & compile it, or use a pre-built quick-start executable binary for selected OS
2.  Edit the template sissm.cfg file (change server name, RCON port/password, path to ISS log file, path to your Admin.txt file etc.)
3.  Start your ISS dedicated server
4.  Start SISSM:  ./sissm sissm.cfg (Linux), ./sissm.exe sissm.cfg (Win/PowerShell), or sissm sissm.cfg (Win/DOS)

There is a "Quickstart" guide available, with a template almost-ready-to-run sissm.cfg requiring only few lines of change.


What are Current Risks and Limitations
==============================

Primarily tested under Debian9/10 and Ubuntu18, Windows version is tested under Windows-10/64 only

SISSM must be installed on the same machine hosting your Sandstorm Dedicated Server.

Tested only for Checkpoint and Hardcord Checkpoint modes with <= 12 players and <= 50 bots.

Insurgency Sandstorm game is still undergoing significant structural changes.  Due to the unpredictability of NWI development, future support for SISSM cannot be guaranteed.
