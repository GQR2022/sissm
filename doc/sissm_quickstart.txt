Simple Insurgency Sandstorm Server Manager - SISSM
Quick Start Guide for SISSM
JS Schroeder -- last updated:  2019.09.01
===============================

This is a quick-start install guide for SISSM, if -- 
*  You are using pre-compiled executable package (Windows/Debian9/Ubuntu18)
*  You already have a working Co-op mode Insurgency Sandstorm Server, and
*  You have full control of your server for installing 3rd party software, 
   e.g., home server or cloud-based VPS (but not a commercial game hosting service)

---------------------------------
Step 1: Your Existing Server
---------------------------------

A) Game.ini -- Make sure RCON is enabled, for example:

[Rcon]
bEnabled=True
Password=mysecretpassword
ListenPort=27015

B)  Your Game Server launcher script -- Make sure logging is enabled

Linux -
./InsurgencyServer-Linux-Shipping [ ...your params... ] -log -LogCmds="LogGameplayEvents Log"

Windows -
InsurgencyServer-Win64-Shipping [ ...your params... ] -log -LogCmds="LogGameplayEvents Log"


NOTE1:  "LogGameplayEvents" is for ISS ver 1.4+, do not use for ver 1.3

NOTE2:  If you are hosting multiple server instances *FROM THE SAME INSTALL FOLDER* you
must specify unique log file for each.  Do this by changing "-log" with e.g., "-log=server1.log",
creating s server1.log file instead of Insurgency.log.  This applies to "Sandstorm Admin 
Wrapper (SAW)" users hosting more than one instance of the game.

---------------------------------
Step 2: Download the Quick Install .zip file to your server
---------------------------------

http://cassandra.confluvium.info/sissm

Download the latest 'quick-start' package and unzip to an empty folder:

*  sissm                Linux executable
*  sissm.exe            Windows executable
*  sissm_example.cfg    Starter configuration (from which you will make a copy and edit)

SISSM must run on the same machine alongside your game server, with read access to 
the game log (Insurgency.log) and Admins.txt files.

First time: make your custom sissm.cfg by copying from the sisssm_example.cfg file.
If you have multiple game instances on the same server you might call it 
sissm1.cfg, sissm2.cfg, etc.

---------------------------------
Step 3:  Edit your sissm.cfg file
---------------------------------

Edit sissm.cfg, find and update four variables at the top.  "//" are comments.

Linux example -- REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN:

sissm.RconPort           27015 
sissm.RconPassword       "mysecretpassword"
sissm.adminListFilePath  "/home/ins/iss/Insurgency/Config/Server/Admins.txt"
sissm.GameLogFile        "/home/ins/iss/Insurgency/Saved/Logs/Insurgency.log"

Windows example -- REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN:

sissm.RconPort           27015 
sissm.RconPassword       "mysecretpassword"
sissm.adminListFilePath  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\sandstorm_server\Insurgency\Config\Server\Admins.txt"
sissm.GameLogFile        "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\sandstorm_server\Insurgency\Saved\Logs\Insurgency.log"

---------------------------------
Step 4:  Run it
---------------------------------

a)  Start your Insurgency Server

b)  Start SISSM

Linux (bash):
    cd [your folder]
    chmod +x sissm
    ./sissm sissm.cfg

Windows Command.com (DOS shell):
    cd [your folder]
    sissm sissm.cfg

Windows PowerShell:
    cd [your folder]
    ./sissm.exe sissm.cfg

c)  Control-C to stop SISSM.

---------------------------------
Step 5:  Customize Your SISSM.CFG file
---------------------------------

SISSM comes with many powerful plugins.  Walk through your sissm.cfg file and 
customize it for your own needs.  

Consult individual plugin documentations on how to setup various features.
Note some plugins are disabled by default on the distribution package.

Almost all of SISSM's messages sent to the game clients are defined in the SISSM.CFG file.
Experiment with localization -- try translating various texts with that of your own language.
